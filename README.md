### Building the Code
No dependency management is used in the project. to build you will need to `go get` those dependencies.

Currently this includes the following..
```
go get github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice
go get github.com/mitchellh/go-homedir
go get github.com/Sirupsen/logrus
go get gopkg.in/yaml.v2
```
